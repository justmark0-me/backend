### How to use it.
If you want the same site. You should fork it then configure secrets of repo, add github runner and start pipeline ‚ò∫Ô∏è !

## Local development
1. You can start development container via `docker-compose up` and need to run all migrations.
2. You will need to import env variables. You can specify them in `.env` and import them via `export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)`
3. Then you can run app (you need to build `run go run src/main.go`)
